                        <p>SKIKA was a community outreach website was my second project.This was a group project.<br>
                           SKIKA was meant to be a page that offers councelling to people in the community who could not afford professional councelling hence SKIKA was formed to bridge that gap.
                        </p>
                        <p>For this project,html was used for coding and css was used to style the web page.</p>
